# Smile detection 
 The goal of this project is to develop a system that can accurately detect smiles in real-time using machine learning techniques. The system relies on two main features for classification: Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Local Binary Patterns (LBP). These features are extracted from facial images and used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.
